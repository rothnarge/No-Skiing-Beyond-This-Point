# No-Skiing-Beyond-This-Point

Simple Ski game created on the AGON Light 2 in BBC Basic
uses VDP 1.04RC1, MOS 1.04 RC1 and BBC Basic 1.05

This is a WIP and the code flow is bad and needs to be rewritten. My first time coding in BBC Basic; I've much to learn.
The game is playable but some collisions go undetected and scrolling jumps every once and a while.

Avoid the trees and Yeti to ski the longest distance.
Movement is with the cursor keys. To stop movement press space(or any other key except ESC).

The keyboard routine is fast but keeps the last value even when no key is pressed. I just got it from FB group and dont understand how it works to fix but it was faster than the GET command at the time.

I may revist as VDP, MOS and BBC Basic mature on the AGON, maybe with sprites instead of characters.

See Ma you can write games on the AGON :D
